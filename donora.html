        <b><i>The Donora Smog</i></b> was a severe air pollution event that occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania, USA, in late October 1948.
        <br><br>

        <h2>Causes</h2><br>The Donora Smog was primarily caused by a combination of industrial pollution and weather conditions. Donora was home to heavy industry, including steel and zinc smelting plants, which emitted large quantities of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter into the atmosphere. A temperature inversion, where a layer of warm air traps cooler air and pollutants close to the ground, exacerbated the accumulation of pollution in the valley where Donora was located.

        <h2>Duration and Severity</h2><br>The Donora Smog lasted for five days, from October 27 to October 31, 1948. During this time, the town was engulfed in a thick, yellowish-gray haze of polluted air. Visibility was severely reduced, and residents experienced respiratory distress, eye irritation, nausea, and other health effects due to exposure to high levels of air pollution.
        <br><br>

        <h2>Health Impacts</h2><br>The Donora Smog had significant health impacts on the residents of Donora and neighboring communities. Hundreds of people fell ill with respiratory problems, and several deaths were attributed to acute respiratory failure and cardiovascular complications exacerbated by the smog. The exact number of casualties remains uncertain, but estimates suggest that at least 20 people died, and thousands suffered from smog-related illnesses.

        <h2>Government Response</h2><br> The Donora Smog drew national attention to the issue of air pollution and prompted calls for government action to address industrial pollution and protect public health. The event highlighted the need for stricter regulations on industrial emissions and improved air quality monitoring and public health infrastructure.
        <br><br>

        <h2>Legacy and Lessons Learned</h2><br>The Donora Smog is considered a watershed moment in the history of environmental health and air quality regulation. The tragedy raised awareness about the dangers of air pollution and paved the way for the development of environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act in the United States. The event also underscored the importance of community activism, public advocacy, and scientific research in addressing environmental health hazards and promoting environmental justice.
        <br><br><br><br><br>

        Overall, the Donora Smog serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impacts of industrial pollution on public health and the environment. The event spurred efforts to improve air quality standards, regulate industrial emissions, and protect communities from the harmful effects of air pollution, leaving a lasting legacy in the field of environmental health and policy.
