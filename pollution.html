        <br />
        <p>
          Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful contaminants into the
          natural environment, which can cause adverse effects on living
          organisms and their habitats. These contaminants can come from various
          sources, including human activities such as industrial processes,
          transportation, agriculture, and waste disposal, as well as natural
          sources like wildfires and volcanic eruptions.

      <h1 class="heading" id="head-air">AIR POLLUTION</h1><br><br>
      Globally, air pollution is a silent killer. The air pollution levels in India are among the highest in the world, posing a heavy threat to the country's health and economy. All of India’s 1.4 billion people are exposed to unhealthy levels of ambient PM 2.5 – the most harmful pollutant - emanating from multiple sources. These small particulates with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns, is about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. Exposure to PM 2.5 can cause such deadly illnesses as lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease. 1.67 million deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, accounting for 17.8% of the total deaths in the country. The health impacts of pollution also represent a heavy cost to the economy. Lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution accounted for economic losses of US$28.8 billion and $8 billion, respectively, in India in 2019. This total loss of $36.8 billion was 1.36% of India's gross domestic product (GDP).
      <br><br>
      PM 2.5 comes from a variety of sources. Some of the most common sources include emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil and biomass such as wood, charcoal, or crop residues. PM 2.5 can also come from windblown dust, including natural dust as well as dust from construction sites, roads, and industrial plants.
      <br><br>
      Over half of PM 2.5 emissions in India are formed in “secondary” way in the upper atmosphere when different types of gaseous pollutants from one area such as ammonia (NH3), mix with other gaseous pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from another place. Agriculture, industry, power plants, households, and transport all contribute significantly to the formation of secondary PM 2.5. This secondary form spreads farther and wider than primary PM2.5 and travels across states, cities, and crosses jurisdictional borders.
      <br><br>
      The air pollution challenge in India is therefore inherently multi-sectoral and multi-jurisdictional, requiring an “airshed” approach. An airshed can be defined as a region that shares a common flow of air, which may become uniformly polluted and stagnant. Air quality within an airshed will largely depend on pollution sources within it. Because the formation of secondary particles and the transporting of primary and secondary particles take place over large geographic areas, airsheds can extend over several hundred kilometers, well beyond the boundaries of cities. India, therefore, needs to look beyond its cities and take action at the sub-national level for effective air pollution control strategies and apply new set of tools for airshed-based management. Standardizing tools across India is important so control strategies and relevant data sets can be linked.

      <div class="air-para">

        <h2>Sources of Air Pollution:</h2>  <br>
        <div class="air-align">
        <b>Mobile Sources</b><br> These include vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and airplanes, which emit pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrocarbons.  <br>
        <b>Stationary Sources</b> <br> These encompass industrial facilities, power plants, refineries, and other stationary sources that emit pollutants during manufacturing processes, combustion, and other operations.    <br>
        <b>Natural Sources</b><br> Certain natural events like wildfires, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and biogenic emissions also contribute to air pollution, releasing particulate matter, gases, and other pollutants into the atmosphere.  <br><br><br>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Air Pollutants:</h2> <br>
        <div class="air-align">
        <b>Particulate Matter (PM)</b><br>      
        Consists of tiny particles suspended in the air, classified based on size (PM10, PM2.5). PM can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, causing respiratory and cardiovascular problems.
        <b>Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)</b><br> 
        Generated from combustion processes, NOx contributes to smog formation, acid rain, and respiratory issues. <br>     
        <b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</b><br> 
        Mainly produced by burning fossil fuels containing sulfur, SO2 contributes to acid rain, respiratory problems, and the formation of fine particulate matter. <br>     
        <b>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b><br>
        A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels, CO can impair oxygen transport in the bloodstream, leading to headaches, dizziness, and even death. <br>       
        <b>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</b><br> 
        Organic chemicals released from various sources, including vehicle exhaust, industrial processes, and solvents. VOCs contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog, and some are carcinogenic. <br>      
        <b>Ozone (O3)</b><br>
        Ground-level ozone is formed by the reaction of NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. It can cause respiratory issues, eye irritation, and damage to vegetation. <br>
        <b>Heavy Metals</b><br>
        Pollutants like lead, mercury, and cadmium can be emitted from industrial processes and vehicle exhaust, posing serious health risks, especially to neurological development. <br><br><br>

        <h2>Health Impacts of Air Pollution:</h2>  <br>
        <div class="air-align">
        <b>Respiratory Diseases</b><br>   
        Air pollution exacerbates respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). <br>
        <b>Cardiovascular Diseases</b><br> 
        Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and hypertension. <br> 
        <b>Cancer</b><br> 
        Some air pollutants, such as benzene and formaldehyde, are known carcinogens and can increase the risk of various cancers. <br> 
        <b>Neurological Effects</b><br> 
        Air pollution has been linked to adverse effects on neurological development, cognitive function, and mental health. <br> 
        <b>Reproductive Health</b><br>      
        Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy can lead to adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and preterm birth. <br><br><br>
        </div>

        <h2>Environmental and Ecological Impacts:</h2> <br>
        <div class="air-align">
        <b>Ecosystem Damage</b><br>  
        Air pollution can harm ecosystems by degrading soil quality, damaging vegetation, and disrupting wildlife habitats. <br>
        <b>Acid Deposition</b><br> 
        Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can contribute to acid rain, which damages forests, soils, aquatic ecosystems, and infrastructure. <br>  
        <b>Global Climate Change</b><br>   
        Some air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), are greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change. <br><br><br>
